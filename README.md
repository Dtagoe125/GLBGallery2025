# GLBGallery2025

A web-based 3D virtual gallery application that creates an immersive museum-like environment for showcasing GLB files. Users can explore and interact with various 3D models displayed as exhibits within the virtual space. The application will utilize Three.js to render the 3D environment and models.

Core features:
- Virtual museum environment with multiple exhibit areas
- GLB file loading and display as interactive 3D exhibits
- User navigation controls for exploring the virtual space
- Interactive elements for each exhibit (e.g., rotation, zooming)
- Information panels for each 3D model

UI/Style:
- Minimalist museum aesthetics with subtle lighting and shadows
- Clean, unobtrusive UI elements that don't detract from the 3D experience
- Atmospheric audio cues to enhance the immersive feeling
